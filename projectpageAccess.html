        <p class="w3-left-align w3-padding-medium">Beginning in April 2014, I worked with professors at DePaul University in Chicago
        and the University of Washington on a project about teaching accessibility. Our paper, 
        <i>Best Practices for Teaching Accessibility in University Classrooms: Cultivating Awareness, Understanding and Appreciation
        for Diverse Users</i> was therefore a cross-geographical endeavour, and resulted in our January 2015 publication in the Transactions on Accessible Computing.</p>
        <p class="w3-left-align w3-padding-medium">For this project, we contacted computer science teachers the top 160 universities in the United States, then
        interviewed the 38 who responded about how they integrate accessibility topics into the program or their particular
        class.</p>
        <p class="w3-left-align w3-padding-medium">In addition to how they taught accessibility, we spoke with interviewees about ways that they get their 
        students to <i>care</i> about accessibility, as well as pitfalls in teaching accessibility.</p>

        <p>Using Omnigraffle, I created a research flow chart for our team to detail what the protocol is for each interaction with our contacts;
        specifically, keywords to search for in the course catalogue and how to handle correspondence from each contact.

        <p>Transcriptions were put into Atlas.ti, an excellent qualitative data analysis tool. I performed an inductive analysis/qualitative coding,
        creating themes which were then entered into a codebook. Other members of the team then marked the transcriptions with what they 
        considered the appropriate code. We limited our themes and sub-categories only to those which met Cohen's Kappa rate as a mark for a "good" agreement. </p>
